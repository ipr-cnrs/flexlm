# .. envvar:: flexlm__licences [[[
#
# Lists to manage vendor daemon and licence files.
#
# ``item.name``
#   Give a short name for the software licence. Avoid whitespace and special
#   caracter cause this var will also be used to name the service.
# ``item.description``
#   Optional. Here you can give a long description of the licence. Also used as
#   service's description.
# ``item.bin_path``
#   Optional. Specify asbolute path of the target directory on the remote host
#   to store vendor daemon binaries. Also used as working directory for the service.
#   [Default : ``/opt/item.name/bin``].
# ``bin_src``
#   Optional. Path from your controller used as source directory to provide the
#   vendor daemon directory on the host. Should be a directory and don't omit
#   the final **/**.
# ``lic_path``
#   Optional. Specify absolut path of the target licence file on the remote
#   host. Also used as argument of the start command for the service.
#   [Default : ``/opt/item.name/etc/licence.lic``].
# ``lic_src``
#   Optional. Path from your controller used as source file to provide the licence
#   file on the host. Should be a file, not a directory.
# ``service``
#   Optional. If the service should be started and enabled.
#   [Default : ``True``].
# ``timewait``
#   Optional. The time (in second) to wait before trying to restart the service
#   after an error. I recommend at least 60 seconds because some vendor daemon
#   keep a connection active even few seconds after the stop.
#   [Default : ``60``].
# ``ports``
#   The list of ports used by this licence.
#   Not used right now.
